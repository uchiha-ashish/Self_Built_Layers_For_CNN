# Problem

The leaf recognition is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision because of almost similar shape, texture and color of the leaves.There has been a lot of work done using various traditional machine learning algorithm and hand-made leaves features. But in this challenge, I tried to make an end-to-end deep learning model for multi-class leaf recognition from scratch.

# Challenges

Looking at the dataset the images were highly augmented and was seemingly captured from different orientations.

# About

Loading of the dataset which contains train and test folders which contains images of 185 different classes.
Stacking of all the images using their path by os for both train and test data.
Getting features and labels in this created data for both train and test.
Running the function inception_block and DeceptiNet built from scratch.
Compiling and fitting of our model to get the scores.

# How to use

Concatenate all the python files and run the code.

# Result

At an epoch of 50 and a batch size of 32, the model gives an accuracy of 86.37% on the test set.
